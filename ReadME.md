Project Name

#   Data Engineering Architecture for Large Scale Data Processing

## Architect: Debanjan Saha


##  Overview

This project involved the development and implementation of a complete data engineering architecture for processing and storing large volumes of data from many different different sources with different types of data. The project included daily, weekly and monthly batch data ingestion, data validation and transformation, data storage, and reporting using various tools and technologies in the Azure cloud environment.

##  Responsibilities

- Designed and led the development of the complete data engineering architecture, including ingestion, transformation, storage, and reporting.
- Led the batch data ingestion (ELT) process using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks, performing various transformations and validations on the data.
- Worked on post-processing the data and saving it into various Data Marts for different consumers.
- Architected data storage solutions using various formats like delta, parquet, and csv, and loaded it into various Azure Synapse external tables, Synapse dedicated pool, and SFTP to clients.
- Created and maintained various pipelines for running data flows, notebooks, and various incremental load, update, and pivot processes.
- Developed real-time interactive Power BI dashboards containing various filters, charts, graphs showing the daily transactions, as well as the timeline.
- Worked on conversion of the architecture into Lake House Architecture.
